# Ultrasound_LIB_Simulation_2D

Some examples solving the 2D wave equation with FEniCS:

1. Dirichlet boundary conditions
2. Neumann boundary conditions

All examples are run from main.py, the path where the results will be saved must be specified and passed to the example function. The grpah function also needs the saving path.
